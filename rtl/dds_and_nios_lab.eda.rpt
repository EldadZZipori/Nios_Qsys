Info (119006): Selected device 5CSEMA5F31C6 for design "dds_and_nios_lab"
Warning: RST port on the PLL is not properly connected on instance DE1_SoC_QSYS:U0|DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll:pll|altera_pll:altera_pll_i|general[1].gpll. The reset port on the PLL should be connected. If the PLL loses lock for any reason, you might need to manually reset the PLL in order to re-establish lock to the reference clock. File: c:/intelfpga_lite/16.1/quartus/libraries/megafunctions/altera_pll.v Line: 749
    Info: Must be connected
Warning (21300): LOCKED port on the PLL is not properly connected on instance "DE1_SoC_QSYS:U0|DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll:pll|altera_pll:altera_pll_i|general[0].gpll". The LOCKED port on the PLL should be connected when the FBOUTCLK port is connected. Although it is unnecessary to connect the LOCKED signal, any logic driven off of an output clock of the PLL will not know when the PLL is locked and ready.
Warning: RST port on the PLL is not properly connected on instance DE1_SoC_QSYS:U0|DE1_SoC_QSYS_vga:vga|DE1_SoC_QSYS_vga_vga_clk:vga_clk|altera_pll:altera_pll_i|general[0].gpll. The reset port on the PLL should be connected. If the PLL loses lock for any reason, you might need to manually reset the PLL in order to re-establish lock to the reference clock.

Warning (21300): LOCKED port on the PLL is not properly connected on instance "DE1_SoC_QSYS:U0|DE1_SoC_QSYS_vga:vga|DE1_SoC_QSYS_vga_vga_clk:vga_clk|altera_pll:altera_pll_i|general[0].gpll". The LOCKED port on the PLL should be connected when the FBOUTCLK port is connected. Although it is unnecessary to connect the LOCKED signal, any logic driven off of an output clock of the PLL will not know when the PLL is locked and ready.
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Error (204012): Can't generate netlist output files because the file "C:/Users/eldad/OneDrive/Desktop/CPEN311/LAB5/Nios_Qsys/rtl/DE1_SoC_QSYS/synthesis/submodules/DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu.v" is an OpenCore Plus time-limited file. Remove the unlicensed cores or obtain a license for those OpenCore Plus time-limited IP cores used in the design. The Intel FPGA Knowledge Database contains many articles with specific details on how to resolve this error. Visit the Knowledge Database at https://www.altera.com/support/support-resources/knowledge-base/search.html and search for this specific error message number.
Error (204009): Can't generate netlist output files because the license for encrypted file "C:/Users/eldad/OneDrive/Desktop/CPEN311/LAB5/Nios_Qsys/rtl/DE1_SoC_QSYS/synthesis/submodules/DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu.v" is not available
